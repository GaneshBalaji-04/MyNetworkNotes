Three common methods of signals:

Bandwidth - Capacity of the medium to carry data.
Digital bandwidth - Maximum Amount of data that can flow from one place to another in a given amount of time.
Measurements - Kbps, Mbps, Gbps
Measurements - Hertz(Wireless)

Throughput - Real amount of data that is flown in the network medium.
            Lets say that the bandwidth of a network medium is 1000Mbps.
            But it is transferring only 60Mbps.
            So this is throughput. Throughput = 60Mbps.
