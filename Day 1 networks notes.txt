Class A IP Address  -  0.0.0.0 to 127.255.255.255
127 is reserved as loopback.
0 reserved for default network.
Actual Range - 1.0.0.0 to 126.255.255.255
IP address 0.0.0.0 is used by the network devices before assigning them an IP address.
In Class A address, The first 8 bits network and the remaining bits are host part.
First bit is 0.
Unicast traffic.

Class B IP Address - 128.0.0.0 - 191.255.255.255
Starts with binary 10
10000000 - 10111111(128 - 191)
First 16 bits - Network part
Next 16 bits - Host part
For example, 172.16.12.13, 172.16 - Network part, 12.13 - Host part.
Second bit is 0.
Unicast traffic.

Class C IP address - 192.0.0.0 to 223.255.255.255
Starts with binary 110
11000000 - 11011111(192 - 223)
First 24 bits - Network part
Next 8 bits - Host part
For example, 192.168.1.1, 192.168.1 - Network part, 1 - Host part
Third bit is 0.
Unicast traffic.

Class D IP Address - 224.0.0.0 to 239.255.255.255
Starts with binary 1110
11100000 - 11101111(224 - 239)

Class E IP Address - reserved
Starts with 1111.
240.0.0.0 to 255.255.255.255
255.255.255.255 reserved for broadcast.



Directed Broadcast Address - Host sends data to all devices on a specific network.
Host portion is populated with binary ones => 255
Disabled by default in modern routers due to security reasons.
Nowadays, Directed Broadcast addresses are dropped by routers and switches by default.
Eg: 172.16.255.255

Local Broadcast Address - communicate with all devices on the local network.
Address is all binary 1's => 11111111.11111111.11111111.11111111 => 255.255.255.255

Eg: Host requesting an IP from the DHCP server; To get the IP address, it has to contact the DHCP server.
The host need to find the DHCP server. For that, It has to broadcast the request for an IP address to all devices in the network.
By this, it finds the DHCP server and gets the IP assigned(Local Broadcast Address).
The Local Broadcast Addresses such as 255.255.255.255 are used for broadcasting messages in the same network layer.
They are meant for communication between the devices in a single network, they are not meant to be routed.
If they are routed, the broadcast messages create an unwanted congestion on the nearby networks.
And also, the local broadcast messages are done by Layer 2 protocol for internal communication.
Thus, they are dropped by Layer 3 devices.
To make the messages routable, DHCP forwarding or DHCP relay need to be enabled.
DHCP forwarding or DHCP relay is the process which allows to get the devices in the particular subnet to get
the IP address if the DHCP server is not available in the particular subnet. The DHCP relay agent makes the local broadcast message
intercepts the broadcast and encapsulates it into a unicast packet and forwards it to the DHCP server in the remote subnet.
That particular DHCP server processes the request and sends the IP address as response which is then delivered it to the client in local subnet.
